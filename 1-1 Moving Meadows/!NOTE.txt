This level was originally included as a Repressed Memory, but due to how buggy it can be, how boring 
it is, and the fact that Flowing Frolic is so similar to it in aesthetics, I decided not to include
it. Nice job finding this text file! If you're familiar with SMBX, feel free to play the level, though 
I can't guarantee that any enjoyment whatsoever...
